StreamFX ships with three different ways to use custom shaders in OBS Studio: Source Shader, Filter Shader and Transition Shader.
Each has slightly different usage, but can mostly work with almost the same shader and allows you to easily use your own or someone elses shaders in OBS Studio.
Shaders allow for quick iteration and enable some effects that were previously impossible.
